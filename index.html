	<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
		vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
		domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
		off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
		he
		looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>

	<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
		collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there
		hung
		a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a
		lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
		lower arm towards the viewer.</p>

	<p>Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane,
		which
		made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but
		that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state
		couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he
		was.
	</p>

	<p>He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and
		only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought,
		"what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out.</p>

	<p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's
		the
		curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people
		all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!</p>

	<p>" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he
		could
		lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which
		he
		didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back
		because
		as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up
		early
		all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.</p>

	<p>You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back
		to
		the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating
		their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that
		would be the best thing for me.</p>

	<p>If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the
		boss
		and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off
		his
		desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates
		from
		up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.</p>

	<p>Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five
		or
		six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though,
		I've
		got to get up, my train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.
		"God in Heaven! " he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later
		than
		half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung?</p>

	<p>He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have
		rung.
		Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept
		peacefully,
		but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were
		to
		catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at
		all
		feel particularly fresh and lively.</p>

	<p>And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been
		there
		to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago.
		The
		office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But
		that
		would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.</p>

	<p>His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of
		having
		a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was
		ever
		ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in
		fact,
		apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than
		usual.</p>

	<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
		vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
		domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide

		If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the
		boss
		and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off
		his
		desk!</p>

	<p>And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up
		there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some
		hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose -
		that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my
		train leaves at five. " And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in Heaven! "
		he
		thought.</p>

	<p>It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like
		quarter
		to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it
		should
		have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling
		noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now?
	</p>

	<p>The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of
		samples
		was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train
		he
		would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go,
		he
		would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss's
		man,
		spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick?</p>

	<p>But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been
		ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of
		having a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one
		was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor
		did
		in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much
		hungrier
		than usual.</p>

	<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
		vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
		domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
		off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
		he
		looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>

	<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
		collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there
		hung
		a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a
		lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
		lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>

	<p>Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit
		longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used
		to
		sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself
		onto
		his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he
		wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that
		he
		had never felt before.</p>

	<p>"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing
		business
		like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of
		travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the
		time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!</p>

	<p>" He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he
		could
		lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which
		he
		didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back
		because
		as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up
		early
		all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a
		life of luxury.</p>

	<p>For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen
		are
		always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on
